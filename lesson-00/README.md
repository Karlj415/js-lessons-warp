# Lesson 0: Course Overview & Setup

Welcome to your JavaScript Full-Stack journey! 🚀

## What You'll Learn in This Course

This course will teach you how to build complete web applications from scratch:

* **Front-end** (what users see): Starting with basic JavaScript, then moving to modern tools like React
* **Back-end** (the server): Using Node.js and Express to handle data and logic
* **Full-stack** (connecting everything): Making your front-end and back-end work together

## Do I Need Experience?

**No!** This course starts from the very beginning. If you can use a computer and browse the web, you're ready to start.

## Tools You'll Need

Before we begin coding, let's install the tools you'll use throughout this course:

### 1. Node.js (Required)
**What it does:** Lets you run JavaScript on your computer (not just in a browser)

**How to install:**
1. Go to https://nodejs.org/
2. Download the **LTS version** (the one marked "Recommended")
3. Run the installer and follow the prompts
4. To verify it worked, open your terminal and type:
   ```bash
   node --version
   ```
   You should see a version number like `v20.x.x`

### 2. Visual Studio Code (Required)
**What it does:** A powerful text editor designed for coding

**How to install:**
1. Go to https://code.visualstudio.com/
2. Download for your operating system
3. Install and open it

### 3. Git (Required)
**What it does:** Tracks changes to your code and lets you save versions

**How to install:**
1. Go to https://git-scm.com/
2. Download and install
3. Verify by typing in terminal:
   ```bash
   git --version
   ```

### 4. Google Chrome (Recommended)
**What it does:** A web browser with excellent developer tools

**How to install:**
1. Go to https://www.google.com/chrome/
2. Download and install

### 5. Postman (Optional - for later lessons)
**What it does:** Tests your back-end APIs

**How to install:**
1. Go to https://www.postman.com/
2. Download and install (you can skip this for now)

## Setting Up VS Code

Once you have VS Code installed, let's add some helpful extensions:

1. Open VS Code
2. Click the Extensions icon on the left sidebar (looks like building blocks)
3. Search for and install these:
   - **ESLint** - Helps catch errors in your code
   - **Prettier** - Automatically formats your code to look nice
   - **Live Server** - Lets you preview web pages instantly

## Your First Project Folder

Let's create a folder where you'll keep all your practice code:

1. Create a folder on your Desktop called `js-learning`
2. Open VS Code
3. Go to File → Open Folder
4. Select your `js-learning` folder

## What's Next?

In Lesson 1, you'll write your first JavaScript code and learn the basics of the language!
